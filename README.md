# random-message

## Purpose
This is a Codecademy Portfolio Project. It is intended to showcase understanding with:
- javacsript
- version control / git

Note: none of the randomly generated messages should be taken seriously. If you take things seriously, don't.

## Requirements
Technically none. This is a pure js project. If you can load a .js file, this should run fine regardless.

Otherwise, download and install Node.js . Then navigate to the folder containing random-message.js, and run:
**node random-message.js**

## Feedback
I highly doubt I will continue this project. As much as I enjoy constructive criticism, please don't expect to see any sort of a response.
